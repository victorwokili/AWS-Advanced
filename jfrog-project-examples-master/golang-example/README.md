# Golang example

## Overview
Go repositories are supported by Artifactory since version 5.11.0.
To work with Go repositories you need to use [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/CLI+for+JFrog+Artifactory) and the Go client.

## Prerequisite
* Install version 1.11 or above of **go**.
* Make sure the **go** command is in your PATH.
* Install [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/)
* Make sure your Artifactory version is 5.11.0 or above
* Make sure your JFrog CLI version is 1.26.0 or above

## Running the Example
'cd' to the root project directory

```console
Configure Artifactory:
> jf c add --url=<JFROG_PLATFORM_URL> [credentials flags]

Configure the project's repositories:
> jf go-config --repo-resolve=<GO_RESOLVE_REPO> --repo-deploy=<GO_DEPLOY_REPO>

Build the project with go and resolve the project dependencies from Artifactory.
> jf go build --build-name=my-build --build-number=1 

Publish version v1.0.0 of the package to the <GO_DEPLOY_REPO> repository in Artifactory.
> jf go-publish v1.0.0 --build-name=my-build --build-number=1

Collect environment variables and add them to the build info.
> jf rt bce my-build 1

Publish the build info to Artifactory.
> jf rt bp my-build 1
```
