# Gradle Artifactory Plugin Examples

## Overview

The Gradle Artifactory Plugin allows you to deploy your build artifacts and build information to Artifactory and also to resolve
your build dependencies from Artifactory.
The Plugin documentation is available [here](https://github.com/jfrog/artifactory-gradle-plugin/#table-of-contents).
We have included a few sample projects to help you get started using the plugin.

## Running the Examples

- The example projects are configured to work with an Artifactory instance accessed through the following URL:<br>
  http://localhost:8081/artifactory<br>
  This URL is defined inside the _build.gradle_ file of each project. Please change it if your Artifactory instance is accessible through a different URL.
- Configure your Artifactory username and password in the _gradle.properties_ file for each project
- Since all example projects are configured to deploy artifacts to 'libs-snapshot-local' repository, it is recommended to create a local repository named _libs-snapshot-local_ or change it inside the build.gradle file of each project.
- Since all example projects are configured to resolve dependencies from 'Maven Central', it is recommended to create a remote repository named _mvn-central_, which proxies *https://repo1.maven.org/maven2* as its URL.
- CD to one of the project's root directory and run the build using one of the following commands:

```console
> gradle artifactoryPublish

or with the gradle wrapper in Unix

> ./gradlew artifactoryPublish

and the gradle wrapper in Windows

> gradlew.bat artifactoryPublish
```

## About the Examples

### gradle-example-minimal

A minimal sample project that uses the Gradle Artifactory Plugin to resolve and publish artifacts to Artifactory.

### gradle-example-ci-server

Gradle sample project to be used with one of the Artifactory CI clients or plugins:

- [JFrog CLI](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/CLI/JFrog+CLI)
- [Jenkins Artifactory Plugin](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Jenkins+Artifactory+Plug-in)
- [Azure DevOps Extension](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Artifactory+Azure+DevOps+Extension)
- [Bamboo Artifactory Plugin](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Bamboo+Artifactory+Plug-in)
- [TeamCity Artifactory Plugin](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/TeamCity+Artifactory+Plug-in)
- [Setup JFrog CLI GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-jfrog-cli)

The Artifactory configuration in this case (repositories, Artifactory credentials, etc.)
is done from the CI client UI.
You can still add the artifactory closure to the build script and have default values configured there,
but the values configured in the CI Server override them.
In this example, the only Artifactory property configured is "artifactoryPublish.skip = true".

#### Important notes for using this example from a CI Server:

- Make sure to have the "Project uses the Artifactory Gradle Plugin" check box in the CI Server UI unchecked, so that the CI Server Plugin automatically applies the Gradle Artifactory Plugin to your
  build script.
- In order to publish the build artifacts to Artifactory, the published artifacts are added to the archives Gradle configuration.

### gradle-example-publish

Sample project that uses the Gradle Artifactory Plugin with Gradle Publications.

### gradle-kts-example-publish

Sample project that configures the Gradle Artifactory Plugin with the Gradle Kotlin DSL.

### gradle-android-example

Sample project that uses the Gradle Artifactory Plugin to deploy Android application (apk) and library (aar) to Artifactory.

Compatible with Android gradle plugin version 3.0.x

### gradle-android-library-ci-server

Sample project that uses the Gradle Artifactory Plugin to deploy Android library (aar) to Artifactory using one of the [Artifactory CI clients or plugins](#gradle-example-ci-server).
