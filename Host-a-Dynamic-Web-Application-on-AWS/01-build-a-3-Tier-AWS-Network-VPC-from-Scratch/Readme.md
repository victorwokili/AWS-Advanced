## Barebone Network Architecture

In the Architecture above the infrastructure is divided into 3 Tiers:

- Public Subnet
- Private App Subnet
- Private Data Subnet

### Public Subnet (Tier 1) 
The public subnet would hold reosurces such as:
- NAT Gateway
- Bastion Host
- Load Balancer <br>

### Private App Subnet (Tier 2) 
This Private subnet would hold our webservers which are reosurces such as:
- EC2 instances <br>

### Private Data Subnet (Tier 3) 
This Private subnet would hold our database which are reosurces such as:
- EC2 instances <br>

**The subnets would be duplicated about multiple availability zones for high availability and fault tolerance** <br>

The following will be created to enable recources have access to the internet:
- Internet Gateway
- Route Tables

## Using the AWS Console to Create a VPC

Always follow the guidance setup from the architectural design <br>
This particular diagram gives us the information for the region where the VPC should be created

### Create a VPC:
1. Select the Region on the AWS Console
   - `US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1`
2. Go to the VPC AWS Service
3. Click on `Create VPC`
4. Give the VPC a Name
    - `Dev VPC`

5. Leave the CIDR Block on IPv4
6. Enter the CIDR Block for Dev VPC
    - `10.0.0.0/16`

7. Leave the following settings as defaul
    - IPv6 CIDR block `NO IPv6 CIDR block`
    - Tenancy : `Default`

8. Click on `Create VPC`

### Enable DNS Hostnames for VPC:
9. Select the `Dev VPC` by the VPC ID under Your VPCs

you would see the DNS hostnames option say `disabled` <br>


10. Under Actions, Click `Edit VPC Settings` <br>

11. Ensure `Enable DNS hostnames` is enabled âœ… , click save.  <br>

12. Double check to make sure DNS hostname now says `Enabled` <br>
